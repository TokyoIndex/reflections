What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git initializes the folder
Git creates a master branch
Git lists the untracked files in the folder
there is also nothing to commit

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is kind of like limbo. It keeps the files separate from the repository and the working director.
It allows for bundling.
It allows you to make one commit per logical change.
