When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working remotely and do not have access to a local machine. 
Also, when working on a collaborate project.
Backing up your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are working on something localling, you want control over when those files are updated from the cloud.
If it was automatic, you might lose some of your changes when someone else updates the remote.
