When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are working remotely and do not have access to a local machine. 
Also, when working on a collaborate project.
Backing up your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you are working on something localling, you want control over when those files are updated from the cloud.
If it was automatic, you might lose some of your changes when someone else updates the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Clone: Copy from Remote to Local or Local to Local.  To work locally.
Forks: Clone on the remote (GitHub) server. Links back to the original repository (repo). To extend someone elses work.
Branches: Different roads the coding takes that can be merged back when needed. When you need to work on an experimental feature without touching the master.
